# CH calling pipeline and filtering scripts

This is the CH calling pipeline used in the "Risk of clonal hematopoiesis in families exposed to radiation following the Chornobyl accident" manuscript. 
The pipeline was developed by the (Bolton Lab)[https://www.kellyboltonlab.org/]. Please refer to the (ArCH manuscript)[https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/40/4/btae121/7629130] and the (ArCH GitHub repository)[https://github.com/kbolton-lab/ArCH] for more information. 

- The annotation files can be found under WDL/AnnotatePD\ Files/ in the ArCH pipeline v1.0.0  https://github.com/kbolton-lab/ArCH/releases/tag/v1.0.0
- The xgb_model files can be found under xgb_model/ in the ArCH pipeline v1.0.0  https://github.com/kbolton-lab/ArCH/releases/tag/v1.0.0
